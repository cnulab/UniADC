We propose a novel unified framework for anomaly detection and classification, called UniADC, which can accurately detect and classify anomalous regions in images using only a few or even no anomalous images. Moreover, UniADC exhibits a powerful anomaly synthesis capability, enabling the generation of class-specific anomalous samples guided by anomaly priors or few-shot anomaly examples.
